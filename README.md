# Overview

This repository contains a templated project and utilities to generate packaged Add-on examples that are easily and
quickly deployed into Seeq via the Add-on Manager. The example packaged Add-on can be used as a starting point for
developing your own Add-ons.

# Prerequisites

The Add-on Example Generator requires the following software to be installed on your machine:

- Python 3.11 or later available on your path as either `python` or `python3`
- Node.js 21.7.3 or later
- On Windows, make sure that long paths are enabled both in Windows RegEdit and Git.
	- You can enable long paths in the Windows RegEdit by running the following command in PowerShell as an
	  administrator:
	  `Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name 'LongPathsEnabled' -Value 1`.
	- To enable long paths in Git, run the following command in Git Bash: `git config --system core.longpaths true`

# Installation

To install the Add-on Example Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/seeq12/seeq-addon-templates.git`)
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run `./install_template` (Linux/Mac) or double-click on `install_template.bat` (Windows) to install the utility.

Once the installation is complete you can run `addon --help` from a terminal window (bash/zsh on Mac or Command
Prompt in Windows) to see the available commands.

# Usage

There are two main commands available in the Add-on Example Generator:

- `addon create` - This command generates a new Add-on project in the specified directory.
- `addon update` - This command updates the Add-on project in the specified directory with the latest version of the
  Add-on Example Generator and the updated answers from the user without recreating the existing virtual
  environment.
- `addon --help` - This command displays the available commands and options.

## Creating a new Add-on project

To create a new Add-on project, follow these steps:

1. Run `addon create <path/to/destination/folder>` from a terminal window.
2. Follow the prompts to answer the questions about the Add-on project.
3. Navigate to the destination folder and follow the instructions in the README.md file of your newly created Add-on
   project.

### After creating your Add-on project

* Open the project in your favorite IDE to start developing your Add-on. VS Code is a good choice if you don't have
  a favorite IDE.
* The answers to your prompts are stored in the `.copier-answers.yml` file in the project folder. You can update the
  answers by running `addon update <path/to/destination/folder>` from a terminal window.
* Navigate to the root directory of the generated project and run the command `python addon.py -h` to get a
  description of the available commands of Add-on Developer Tools.
* Open the README.md file in the project folder to get started with the Add-on project.

# Updates

To update the Add-on Example Generator, follow these steps:

1. Run `git checkout develop` in the root directory of the cloned repository to get the latest version of the Add-on
   Example Generator.
2. Run `git pull` to update your local repository with the latest changes.
3. Run `./install_template` (Linux/Mac) or double-click on `install_template.bat` (Windows) to re-install the utility.

Once the installation is complete you can run `addon --help` from a terminal window (bash/zsh on Mac or Command
Prompt in Windows) to see the available commands.
