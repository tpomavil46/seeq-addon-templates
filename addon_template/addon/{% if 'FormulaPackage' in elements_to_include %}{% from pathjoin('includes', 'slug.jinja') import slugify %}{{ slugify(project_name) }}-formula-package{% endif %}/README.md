# Overview

This is an example to create a User Defined Formula Package in Seeq. The formula package is a collection of formulas
that can be used in Seeq Workbench. This example contains two formulas: `signalAdder` and `signalMultiplier` which add
and multiply two signals, respectively.

More information on how to set up a json file for a formula package can be found in
the [Creating User Defined Formula Functions](https://support.seeq.com/kb/latest/cloud/creating-user-defined-formula-functions).
